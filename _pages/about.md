Hi, I'm Santosh. I graduated from [NIT-Trichy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Technology,_Tiruchirappalli) with Bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering and am currently working on my PhD in theoretical physics at [Case Western Reserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_Western_Reserve_University) University. After a short stint in gravitational physics, I now work in a subfield of physics called Condensed Matter Theory (CMT). My research is focused on understanding emergent quantum phenomena in systems where a collection of quantum particles are put together ,especially fermions (electrons). In particular, I am interested in the emergent topology in both interacting and non interacting fermions and low energy excitations of them. Another interesting problem I work in involves systems where the approximation of weakly/non-interacting physics breaks down and strong correlations come into play. This leads to extremely weired physics including unconventional Superconductivity, Mott transitions, Correlated metals etc. I use both analytical and numerical tools involving Python/Julia/C/FORTRAN coding to solve equations in Higher Performance Clusters (HPCs)

Apart from these, I'm interested in a lot of domains, particularly in the intersection of mathematics, Physics, Computer Science and music. Among these, of particular interest is stochastic differential equations (SDE) and its applied use in music, sports and quant finance, if you are interested in cricket, do take a look at the recent preprint ["Stochastic differential theory of cricket"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07372) and ["Information flow in political elections: a stochastic perspective"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05198), where I use the ideas from stochastic processes to understand cricket and elections. I also love powerlifting, playing [mridangam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mridangam), [taking photographs](https://www.flickr.com/photos/santyphotography/), [Graphic designing](https://www.behance.net/instrumentsantosh) and reading.

I also developed and "maintain" these open source packages which was initially started to ease my PhD work flow

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/santoshkumarradha/pysktb">pySKTB </a> - Scientific Python package for solving Slater Koster tight-binding Hamiltonian</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/santoshkumarradha/pyquestaal">pyQuestaal</a> - Python class to interface with <a href="http://questaal.org">QUESTAAL</a> Quantum codes, which is a suite of electronic structure programs. </li>
</ul>
