    <p>Often times, a candidate’s attractiveness is directly associated with his clear ideologies and opin- ions on various policies and social issues. Using the ideas of stochastic differential equations and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process, we develop a phenomenological model to understand the effect of (un)clearly communicating a candidate’s stance on policies to the voting public. We will show that, counter intuitively, there are quantifiable advantages to be vague on one’s stance.</p>

    <p>Based on the recently found non-trivial topology of buckled antimonene, we propose the conceptual design of a quantized switch that is protected by topology and a mechanism to create configurable 1D wire channels. We show that the topologically required edge states in this system can be turned on and off by breaking the inversion symmetry (reducing the symmetry from S<sub>6</sub> to C<sub>3</sub>), which can be achieved by gating the system. This is shown to create a field-effect quantum switch projected by topology. Secondly we show that by locally gating the system with different polarity in different areas, a soliton-like domain wall is created at their interface, which hosts a protected electronic state, in which transport could be accessed by gated doping.</p>

    <p>First-principles calculations show the formation of a 2D spin polarized electron (hole) gas on the Li (CoO<sub>2</sub>) terminated surfaces of finite slabs down to a monolayer of LiCoO2 in remarkable contrast with the bulk band structure stabilized by Li donating its electron to the CoO2 layer forming a Co-d−t<sup>2g</sup> insulator. By mapping the first-principles computational results to a minimal tight-binding models corresponding to a non-chiral 3D generalization of the quadripartite Su-Schriefer-Heeger (SSH4) model, we show that these surface states have topological origin.</p>

With the help of ab-initio calculations and tight binding models along with symmetry considerations we show that monolayer buckled honeycomb structures of group-V elements (Sb,As), which have already been synthesized, belong in this category and have a charge fractionalization of e/2 at the corner states as well as weak topological edge states, all protected by their properties under the inversion operation which classify this system as a quadrupole topological insulator.</p>

    <p>Transition metal oxides often possess complex interactions between charge, spin, lattice, and orbital degrees of freedom, resulting in correlated electronic and magnetic phases. LixCoO2 is one such material. One of the most commonly used cathode choices in rechargeable batteries, this oxide also evidences numerous correlated effects, evolving as a function of lithium content (x). Due to the strong electrostatic forces which govern the layered nature of this material, however, most investigations of these behaviors have been on bulk forms (&gt;0.1mm). In the 2D limit, correlated effects are more easily tuned and studied, therefore it is of fundamental importance to develop an experimental basis for investigation. Herein, a two-step process is utilized to chemically delithiate and exfoliate LiCoO2 single crystals and study nanoflakes 10-60nm thick, with 0.37 &lt; x &lt; 0.8. An initial electrical characterization of this new form reflects bulk conduction properties, verifying the reliability of this new technique: temperature-dependent resistance measurements indicate an insulating 2D variable ranging hopping conduction for samples of x&gt;0.75, and metallic characteristics with a finite residual conductance for x&lt;0.75. However, these thin flakes also exhibit correlated characteristics less commonly observed and understood in LixCoO2. An energy barrier upon contact formation is observed for all conditions, independent of lithium concentration and electrode work function, suggesting enhanced correlated effects due to reduced dimensionality. Additionally, charge ordering phenomena in the temperature-dependent resistance occur under specific preparation conditions. These anomalies are markedly larger in magnitude than previous accounts in bulk systems, and are also found in low-lithium ranges of x&lt;0.5, matching theoretical predictions not commonly observed experimentally. This work utilizes a new approach to gain insight behind the complex transport phenomena inherent in LixCoO2, providing a new opportunity to understand these correlated effects using a 2D, single crystal form.</p>

    <p>A new formalism for analyzing the progression of cricket game using Stochastic differential equation (SDE) is introduced. This theory enables a quantitative way of representing every team using three key variables which have physical meaning associated with them. This is in contrast with the traditional system of rating/ranking teams based on combination of different statical cumulants. Further more, using this formalism, a new method to calculate the winning probability as a progression of number of balls is given.</p>

    <p>The alkali-trihalogeno-germanates AGeX<sub>3</sub> with A a large single positive ion such as Rb, Cs, or organic radicals such as methyl ammonium (MA), and X a halogen (I, Br, Cl, F) along with the corresponding stannates (ASnX3) and plumbates (APbX<sub>3</sub>) exhibit a large variety of crystal structures, some of which are of the perovskite type. These materials, better known as "halide perovskites” have recently gained worldwide attention as promising photovoltaic and more broadly opto-electronic materials. But their stability problems relative to the non-perovskite phases is a major issue. Here we show that the phase relations in these materials can be understood in terms of the relative orientation of the GeX3 tetrahedral units, which is ferroelectric in the perovskite phase but antiferroelectric in the competing phases. This suggests that an applied electric field could be used to stabilize the desired phases and trigger a phase transition between two phases of the material with widely different optical and electronic properties.</p>

    <p>The electronic band topology of monolayer β-Sb (antimonene) is studied from the flat honeycomb to the equilibrium buckled structure using first-principles calculations and analyzed using a tight-binding model and low energy Hamiltonians. In flat monolayer Sb, the Fermi level occurs near the intersection of two warped Dirac cones, one associated with the pz-orbitals, and one with the px,py-orbitals. The differently oriented threefold warping of these two cones leads to an unusually shaped nodal line, which leads to anisotropic in-plane transport properties and goniopolarity. A slight buckling opens a gap along the nodal line except at six remaining Dirac points, protected by symmetry. Under increasing buckling, pairs of Dirac points of opposite winding number annihilate at a critical buckling angle. At a second critical angle, the remaining Dirac points disappear when the band structure becomes a trivial semiconductor. Spin-orbit coupling and edge states are discussed.</p>

    <p>We walk through derivation of the ubiquitous Hedin equations using Quantum Many-Body Perturbation theory (QMBPT). QMBPT is full of rich diagrams showing the symmetries of myriad interactions of particles and anti-particles, giving us insights on how to miss-match and add different interactions important to the specific system we are dealing with. This is in contrast with the usual presentation of Hedin’s equations derived using variational principle and quantum linear response theory, where an equivalent but analytic functional approach of probing the system with fictitious infinitesimal field is used.</p>
